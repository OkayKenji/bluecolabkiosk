# Blue CoLab Kiosk

A basic Kiosk demo for Blue CoLab.

## Perquisites
1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
   1. Git helps manage the versions of the kiosk. For us it also helps as a way to collaborate and share the code.
2. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en).
   1. Node is used to run [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) outside your browser. For us we use as node installs [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as well. npm is a way to download prewritten code by others that helps the project run.
      1. If you're familiar with python, npm is like [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
3. Install code editor of your choice.
   1. Suggested [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
